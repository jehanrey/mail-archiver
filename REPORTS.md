## Reports

### Initial impression
My initial impression was that the activity seemed doable. I haven't made a UI similar to this but I thought that given an appropriate time, I can accomplish the activity. The responsive nature of the mockup seemed to be a challenging aspect, but one that I was eager to figure out.

### During the activity
I was very excited to be able to use React hooks again, because in my current project, our version of React still did not include them. It was a nice experience to brush up my React skills using React hooks. It was also exciting for me to create the application from scratch where I get to decide most things. I even opted not to use third party components except for the date picker.

I learned new things as well, I encountered an error I have never encountered before. This was relating to the way I used React hooks, I wasn't really aware that it was not recommended to use them on conditionally rendered components.

This was also my first time making a responsive UI wherein a different component is rendered per breakpoint. I found that it would be difficult to conform the table view and the list view in a single component so I opted to have them separate from each other instead.

### Overall
I was happy with how my work turned out. I found it really enjoyable to be able to create a React application from scratch again.
